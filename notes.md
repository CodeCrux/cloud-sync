  If you need more control, you can change columns, sync frequency, set filters to only sync subset of objects. You can also pause or stop the sync at any time.

3) That's it
  Just relax and let our software do what it does best: seamless two-way syncing. Let us worry about your data. There is no need to intervene, though you can always check the dashboard to see how many objects DataCol added or updated for you.
